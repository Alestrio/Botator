Hello!
Here you can find all the informations we store about you & your server when you use botator, and how to delete them and who can access them.
## What informations do we store?
1. Your server's ID
2. Your channel's id (the one you choose in the setup)
3. All the advaned settings you choose with `/advanced`, your bot's prefix (`/prefix`) who your bot pretends to be (if you set that up).
5. How much times you used the bot today.
4. That\'s it. We will **NOT** store your messages, and any other information.

## Who can access them?
The bot can acces the informations, obviously, but also the developpers, can theoretically acces thoose informations, but none of them will do that.
## How can I delete my informations?
**You can always delete your informations by doing the command `/delete`, except for the quild ID and how much times you used the bot today. You can request your guild's id deletition in our support server [here](https://discord.gg/pB6hXtUeDv). The number of times you used the bot today is automatically deleted every day.**
